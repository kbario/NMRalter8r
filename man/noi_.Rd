\title{Noise Estimation}
\usage{
noi_(x, p)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The read in spectra}

\item{p}{the matched ppm var to your x}
}
\value{
an estimation of noise level of the provided x spectrum
}
\description{
This function estimates the noise of an NMR spectrum through the analysis of the upper end of the spectrum.
}
\details{
Noise in an NMR spectrum is inevitable and a product of the detectors in the spectrometer. But noise only introduces error to spectral analysis so removing values below the noise threshold makes data analysis on spectra more robust.
\code{noi_()} gets the index of the ppm between 9.5 and 11 and calculates the trimmed mean and the standard deviation of the x values within this chemical shift.
From there, the standard deviation is multiplied by 5 and the mean is add to provide a maximum estimation of noise in that spectrum.
This method was developed from the paper by Torgrip et al. (2008) and can be found in the link in see also.
