\title{Chemical Shift Picking}
\usage{
shift_pickr(x, p, sh, pm = 0.005)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The spectrum of which you want to calculate the total area}

\item{p}{The matched ppm variable to x}

\item{sh}{Takes arrangements of values:
\enumerate{
\item The first is two values where the first is the lower ppm value and the second is the upper ppm value. This is then parsed to \code{get_idx()} to find the idx which is then parsed to the x variable.
\item The second arrangement is an array of numbers that are interpreted as the already calculated idx values and are parse straight to the x variable
}}

\item{pm}{The plus/minus value you want to add or subtract from the peak. Default = 0.005}
}
\value{
An array of values mapped to defined peak
}
\description{
\code{shift_pickr()} is programmed to search a given ppm region for a maximum value (i.e., the apex of a metabolite peak) and return the chemical shift that best encapsulates said peak. Is most useful when picking peaks to estimate their area.
}
\details{
\code{shift_pickr()} takes chemical shift region in the \strong{sh} parameter and searches for the largest value in x in that chemical shift.
From there, the value of pm is added and subtracted from the ppm where the maximum x values resides to give a shift that best encapsulates the peak which is then returned by the function.

\examples{
data(x,p)
idx <- shift_pickr(x, p, sh = c(5,5.5), pm = 0.01)
