# NMRadjustr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of NMRadjustr is to allow acquisition of almost completely normalised NMR spectra straight of the spectroscope. By adjusting the number of scans based on the sample concentration, you can reduce the influence noise has on the data analysis later on down the pipeline which creates more robust and accurate results

## Installation

You can install the released version of NMRadjustr from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("NMRadjustr")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kylebario/NMRadjustr")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(NMRadjustr)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
